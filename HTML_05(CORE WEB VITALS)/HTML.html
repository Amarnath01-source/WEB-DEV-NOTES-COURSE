2.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):is a stable Core Web Vital metric. It's an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because 
  it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts.bacically iy make sure that when websites load the paragraph layer or anty text 
  which is not loaded then its position is taken by other elements when it take some time to load 
  if you clicked into a button or any then that element pop up and you clicked so to prevent this mishappening we use cls core web vitals(how many element
  layers shifted while loading a website and the time take to fully load a website ) 
  more layers in t time bad cli
  less layers in t time means good cli
