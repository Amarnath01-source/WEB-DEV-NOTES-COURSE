 <!-- HTML quotation tag: is commonly used in textual content.
      <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations 

      (i) What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
      The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML.
         While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.

      (ii)Why Use These Tags?
      They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines
      to understand the context and relevance of the content.-->
      <!-- <blockquote> use case -->

        <!-- Code Tag: Used to write code in web page.NOTE:hesre you can see that code tag is always written inside pre tag because
             it preserves whitespace and line breaks, which is crucial for displaying code accurately
             but we have to inclide HTML entities tag otherwies it will not work.   -->
