<!--  There are three different ways to add CSS to an HTML page, which are:
      1.Inline CSS: Inline CSS is used to add custom properties to specific elements. The added style will only reflect on that particular element only.
        To use inline CSS, insert the <style></style> attribute within the HTML element's opening tag.
        Note: The downside of using inline CSS is that once the project complexity increases, it will become difficult to manage the styles of each individual element.
        use it rarely

      2.Internal CSS:Internal CSS is used to apply custom style to multiple elements on the same page. The style can be used throughout the HTML page.
        Internal CSS is defined in a style block, which will be inside the head section.
        use to make minor tweeks
      3.External CSS:we make a another file in .css format amd we link that file using link tag.<link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css (style.css)">
        use to build serious industry level website.
         
        The following points will explain each keyword's meaning:
        (i) <link>: This tag is used to create links between different resources, like stylesheets, fonts, and more. In our case, we are using a link tag to link the CSS file with the HTML file.
        
        (ii)rel="stylesheet": rel stands for relationship, this defines the type of relationship between the HTML document and the linked resource. When set to "stylesheet", it specifies that 
        the linked resource is a stylesheet that will be used to style the HTML content.
        
        (iii)href="style.css": The href attribute stands for "hypertext reference." It specifies the path or URL to the external resource we want to link. In this case, it's the path to the
        external CSS file called "style.css".--->
